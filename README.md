## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Loading

The dataset is loaded using Pandas and inspected for structure and consistency.

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis

* Checked data types and summary statistics
* Studied feature–target relationships
* Visualized trends using scatter plots

### 3️⃣ Model Building

A **Linear Regression** model was trained to learn the relationship between housing features and price.

### 4️⃣ Evaluation

Model performance was measured using:

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** — to quantify prediction accuracy.

### 5️⃣ Visualization

The regression line was plotted against actual values to interpret prediction behavior.
